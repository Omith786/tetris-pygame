# tetris-pygame

This project is a modern take on the timeless puzzle game Tetris, built entirely in Python using the Pygame library. The goal was not only to recreate the addictive gameplay loop but also to design it in a way that’s clean, approachable, and easy for others to learn from.

At its core, the game follows the familiar mechanics: tetrominoes fall from the top of the screen, and the player must rotate and move them into position to clear lines. However, my version adds a few unique touches that set it apart from a straightforward clone. The codebase is structured with readability in mind, making it beginner-friendly for those who want to see how a game like this is built from scratch. I also focused on smoother piece movement, intuitive controls, and a foundation that can easily be extended with new features like scoring variations, colour themes, or even multiplayer.

Some highlights of this project include:

- Classic mechanics with a modern polish – responsive controls and a clean, minimal UI.

- Structured and readable codebase – designed so others can learn how Pygame handles game loops, events, and rendering.

- Easy to extend – the project is intentionally built to be a base for experimenting (e.g., custom block shapes, scoring rules, or AI opponents).

- A personal spin – rather than just “copying Tetris,” I treated this as a way to explore game design choices, balancing tradition with small tweaks for fun.

Ultimately, this project is both a playable game and a learning exercise. It captures the spirit of Tetris while serving as a stepping stone into game development with Python.
